# Credit-Card-Report-Dashboard-in-Power-BI

Iâ€™m excited to share that I recently completed another Power BI dashboard project with the guidance of my mentor @Rishabh Mishra, a working professional who actively supports students and professionals in leveling up their Data Analytics skills.

ðŸ“Š In this project, we focused on:
â€¢	Using a variety of chart types to visualize data from multiple angles
â€¢	Writing powerful DAX formulas to create dynamic KPIs
â€¢	Applying extensive formatting to ensure the dashboard is both functional and visually appealing
â€¢	Keeping the design simple yet impactful, focused on delivering real-time insights clearly

This project was a great opportunity to sharpen my skills in Power BI, DAX, and dashboard storytelling â€” and I'm excited to continue building on this momentum!

ðŸ”§ Tools Used: Power BI | Power Query | DAX
A big thank you to @Rishabh Mishra for the guidance and support throughout! ðŸ™Œ
